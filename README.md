# Writing to excel files from python program
> My goal was to learn how to use the xlsxwriter python library to write data to an excel spreadsheet. I wanted to try to create a program that could possibly make data entry a little easier.

## What did I learn?

- That xlsxwriter is farily straight forward
- You cannot use this library to edit existing excel files
- You can name your file when you call `workbook = xlsxwriter.Workbook("NameOfFile.xlsx")`

## Furute iterations
> I would really like to take this program a step further and have it take user input which will then transfer over to the file after being ran. Ideally someone would use this program from data-entry or something like keeping track of how many students are attending a program etc.
